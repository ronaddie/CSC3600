Mobile Telephony
----------------
#\large
As mentioned in the chronology, above, mobile phones were first used in 1924. However,
it was not till much later, around 1978, that they became widespread. \\[5mm]
%
Wireless signals lose strength approximately according to the inverse square law,
which means that the loss (in power) over a certain distance is a factor of 4 greater
if that distance is doubled. More generally, if the distance is increased by the factor
$a$, the loss will be greater by the factor $\frac{1}{ a^2}$.\\[5mm]
%

Mobile Telephony (cont)
----------------
Inverse-square loss
means that the signals of our neighours, and fellow citizens, cause less interference,
so long as they are distant.\\[5mm]
%
So, we subdivide the domain where communication is taking
place into {\em cells}. The frequencies in use can then be {\em re-used} in cells that
are not too close.\\[5mm]

Wireless LANs
-------------
Let's call the history of wireless since the introduction of the Internet {\em modern}.\\[5mm]
%
In 1985, the idea that some wireless spectrum can be {\em unlicensed} was introduced.\\[5mm]
%
The only regulation is that no transmitter should use more than $\approx 10$ milliamps.\\[5mm]
%
The wifi standards: 802.11a, b, \dots.

Channel Capacity
---------------
#\large
Shannon\index{Shannon} gives the maximum data rate in the presence of noise,
as follows:
$$
C \leq B \log_{2} (1 + S/N)
$$
where $C$ is the channel capacity (transmission speed in bits/s), $B$ is the bandwidth, and $S/N$ is the 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\index{signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)},
which is the ratio of the power levels of the signal and the noise. 

Shared Spectrum
---------------
#\large
As the density of users of wireless spectrum goes up, 
we can achieve better efficiency by 
closer spacing of transmitters and receivers.\\[5mm]
This occurs naturally, as the number of base stations or wireless access points
increase.\\[5mm]
{\em Shared use} of spectrum is much more efficient than allocated or regulated use.
Star-link is a great example of this.

Where Next
------
%
Higher frequencies are more in use. 
More subject to interference by obstacles, or the atmosphere. \\[5mm]
%
Aerial designs need to be more complex. \\[5mm]
%
However, the {\em quantity} of bandwidth  becomes dramatically larger.
