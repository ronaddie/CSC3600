Mobile Telephony
----------------
As mentioned in the chronology, above, mobile phones were first used in 1924. However,
it was not till much later that they became widespread. \\[5mm]

Wireless LANs
-------------
For the moment it seems to reasonable to call the history of wireless since the introduction 
of the Internet {\em modern}.
