\section{introduction}

The 802.11 family of protocols is framed as at layer 2, like ethernet, and, rather than introducing a 
completely new protocol at layer 2, the ethernet protocol has been {\em adapted} for use by
wireless devices in the 802.11 family. Wifi is viewed as another alternative for implementation of
a {\em local area network} (LAN). Ethernet is widely used for this purpose, but there are many
alternative technologies operating at this layer. In fact, the ethernet protocol itself is
subject to some significant variations which require different fields in the layer 2 frame headers,
and different lengths for these headers.

Although ethernet was originally an {\em industry standard}, i.e. it was developed by a private
company, and later standarized, after some years the management of the ethernet family of protocols
was passed to the IEEE and continues to be managed by the IEEE at the present time \cite{802.3wiki,802.3web}.
