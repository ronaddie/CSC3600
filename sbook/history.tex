\section*{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}

\item Gain an understanding and appreciation of the history and evolution of wireless communication.

\item Develop insight into the sort of developments likely to take place in wireless communication
in the next few years.

\section{Wireless Chronology}

A brief chronology for the discovery and development of electromagnetism and wireless
communication is shown in Figure \ref{chronology}.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{12cm}|}
\hline
\bf Year & \bf Discovery / Development \\
\hline
1804 & Joseph Fourier discovers that all signals can be decomposed into frequencies \\
1820 & Danish physicist Hans Christian Orsted discovers electromagnetic fields \\
1831 & British scientist Michael Faraday discovers electromagnetic induction \\

	(which is later discovered to be the general form of light)\\

\section{Mobile Telephony}

As mentioned in the chronology, above, mobile phones were first used in 1924. However,
it was not till much later, around 1978, that they became widespread. 

Wireless signals lose strength approximately according to the inverse square law,
which means that the loss (in power) over a certain distance is a factor of 4 greater
if that distance is doubled. More generally, if the distance is increased by the factor
$a$, the loss will be greater by the factor $\frac{1}{ a^2}$. 

This might seem a disadvantage, but in fact it is probably mostly beneficial, because it 
means that the signals of our neighours, and fellow citizens, cause very little interference,
with our communication, so long as they take place a little way off.

As a consequence, it makes sense to subdivide the region where wireless communication is taking
place into {\em cells}. The frequencies in use in one cell can then be re-used in a cell that
is not too close

\section{The Modern Era of Wireless Communication}

For the moment it seems to reasonable to call the history of wireless since the introduction 
of the Internet {\em modern}.

In 1985, the idea that some wireless spectrum can be {\em unlicensed} was introduced.

The only regulation is that no transmitter should use more than about 10 milliamps.

This allowed for the wifi standards: 802.11a, b, \dots.

\section{Where Wireless is Heading}

Some general trends in wireless communication can be observed. 

Higher and higher frequencies are coming into regular use. These higher frequencies have some disadvantages, such
as being more easily blocked by obstacles, or atmospheric conditions. Also, because the wavelength
of higher frequency signals is smaller than 1cm, and in some cases just a few millimetres, aerial designs need
to be more complex in order to receive an adequate strength signal. However, a major advantage of higher frequencies
is that as we move up the spectrum, the {\em quantity} of bandwidth (this term will be explained later) becomes
dramatically larger.
