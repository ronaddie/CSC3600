\section*{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}

\item Gain an understanding and appreciation of the history and evolution of wireless communication.

\item Develop insight into the sort of developments likely to take place in wireless communication
in the next few years.

\end{itemize}

\section{Wireless Chronology}

A brief chronology for the discovery and development of electromagnetism and wireless
communication is shown in Figure \ref{chronology}.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{12cm}|}
\hline
\bf Year & \bf Discovery / Development \\
\hline
1804 & Joseph Fourier discovers that all signals can be decomposed into frequencies \\
1820 & Danish physicist Hans Christian Orsted discovers electromagnetic fields \\
1831 & British scientist Michael Faraday discovers electromagnetic induction \\
1864 & Scottish mathematician and physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovers the partial differential equations for electromagnetic waves
	(which is later discovered to be the general form of light)\\
1888 & Hertz produces, transmits, and receivs electromagnetic waves \\
1895 & Marconi transmits and receives a coded message at a distance of 1.75 miles \\
1899 & Marconi sends the first international wireless message from England to France\\
1923 & The decibel (1/10th of a bel, after A. G. Bell, inventor of the telephone) used to express loss (of power) \\
1924 & The mobile telephone invented by Bell Telephone and introduced to NYC police \\
1932 & The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) formed \\
1948 & Branttain, Bardeen and Shockley build the junction transistor\\
1948 & Claude Shannon develops the theoretical foundations of digital communications \\
1978 & AT\&T Bell Labs test a mobile telephone system based on cells\\
1990 & WWW developed\\

\section{Mobile Telephony}

As mentioned in the chronology, above, mobile phones were first used in 1924. However,
it was not till much later that they became widespread. \\[5mm]

\section{The Modern Era of Wireless Communication}

For the moment it seems to reasonable to call the history of wireless since the introduction 
of the Internet {\em modern}.
